Welcome to my SQL project, where I analyze real-time data from **Flipkart**! This project uses a dataset of **20,000+ sales records** and additional tables for payments, products, and shipping data to explore and analyze e-commerce transactions, product sales, and customer interactions. The project aims to solve business problems through SQL queries, helping Flipkart make informed decisions.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates essential SQL skills by analyzing e-commerce data from **Flipkart**, focusing on sales, payments, products, and customer data. Through SQL, we answer critical business questions, uncover trends, and derive actionable insights that help improve business strategies and customer experiences. The project covers different SQL techniques including **Joins**, **Group By**, **Aggregations**, and **Date Functions**.

## Project Structure

1. **SQL Scripts**: Contains code to create the database schema and write queries for analysis.
2. **Dataset**: Real-time data representing e-commerce transactions, product details, customer information, and shipping status.
3. **Analysis**: SQL queries crafted to solve business problems, each focusing on understanding e-commerce sales and performance.

## Database Schema

Hereâ€™s an overview of the database structure:

### 1. **Customers Table**
- **customer_id**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **customer_name**: Name of the customer
- **state**: Location (state) of the customer

### 2. **Products Table**
- **product_id**: Unique identifier for each product
- **product_name**: Name of the product
- **price**: Price of the product
- **cogs**: Cost of goods sold
- **category**: Category of the product
- **brand**: Brand name of the product

### 3. **Sales Table**
- **order_id**: Unique order identifier
- **order_date**: Date the order was placed
- **customer_id**: Linked to the `customers` table
- **order_status**: Status of the order (e.g., Completed, Cancelled)
- **product_id**: Linked to the `products` table
- **quantity**: Quantity of products sold
- **price_per_unit**: Price per unit of the product

### 4. **Payments Table**
- **payment_id**: Unique payment identifier
- **order_id**: Linked to the `sales` table
- **payment_date**: Date the payment was made
- **payment_status**: Status of the payment (e.g., Payment Successed, Payment Failed)

### 5. **Shippings Table**

- **return_date**: Date the order was returned (if applicable)
- **shipping_providers**: Shipping provider (e.g., Ekart, Bluedart)
- **delivery_status**: Status of delivery (e.g., Delivered, Returned)

## Business Problems

The following queries were created to solve specific business questions. Each query is designed to provide insights based on sales, payments, products, and customer data.

### Easy 
1. Retrieve a list of all customers with their corresponding product names they ordered (use an INNER JOIN between customers and sales tables).
```sql
SELECT 
c.customer_name,
p.product_name
FROM customers AS c
INNER JOIN sales AS s
ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
INNER JOIN products AS p
ON p.product_id = s.product_id;
```
2. List all products and show the details of customers who have placed orders for them. Include products that have no orders (use a LEFT JOIN between products and sales tables).
```sql
SELECT 
p.product_name,
c.customer_name
FROM products AS p
LEFT JOIN sales AS s
ON p.product_id = s.product_id
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id;
```
3. List all orders and their shipping status. Include orders that do not have any shipping records (use a LEFT JOINbetween sales and shippings tables).
```sql
SELECT
s.order_id,
s.customer_id,
sh.shipping_id,
sh.shipping_date,
sh.delivery_status
FROM sales AS s
LEFT JOIN shipping AS sh
ON s.order_id = sh.order_id;
```
4. Retrieve all products, including those with no orders, along with their price. Use a RIGHT JOIN between the products and sales tables.
```sql
SELECT 
p.product_name,
p.price,
s.order_status
FROM sales AS s
RIGHT JOIN products AS p
ON p.product_id = s.product_id;
```
5.Get a list of all customers who have placed orders, including those with no payment records. Use a FULL OUTER JOIN between the customers and payments tables.
```sql
SELECT
c.customer_name,
p.payment_status
FROM customers AS c
FULL OUTER JOIN sales AS s
ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
FULL OUTER JOIN payments AS p
ON p.order_id = s.order_id;
```
